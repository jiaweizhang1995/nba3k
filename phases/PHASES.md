## Working agreements

- **Each phase ends with a Bash-verifiable artifact.** No phase signs off without the assertion command from its doc passing.
- **Per-phase doc is updated continuously** during the phase: sub-task status, decisions made, deviations from plan, blockers surfaced.
- **TUI 8-menu policy:** Home / Roster / Rotation / Trades / Draft / Finance / Calendar / Settings.
- **Phases M2+ use agent teams** (TeamCreate) with non-overlapping crate ownership. Orchestrator (main session) does integration + verification.
- **Memory layer** in `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` captures durable project context that survives across sessions. Per-phase docs capture in-flight work.

## Agent team conventions

- One team per active phase. Team name format: `nba3k-m{N}`.
- Worker assignments are by **crate path ownership** (e.g., `nba3k-scrape`) so workers don't collide.
- Integration/glue work (CLI wiring, end-to-end verification) is done by orchestrator after workers complete, not by workers themselves.
- Workers communicate progress via `TaskUpdate` on the shared team task list. Orchestrator monitors via `TaskList`.

## Documents

- `RESEARCH.md` — open-items research output (one-shot, refresh as needed)
- `phases/M{N}-*.md` — per-phase plan + log
- `~/.claude/plans/bubbly-roaming-thacker.md` — original approved plan (immutable reference)
